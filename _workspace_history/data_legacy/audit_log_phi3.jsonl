Instead, there was significant concern about job displacement due to automation and the need for retraining or reskilling in response to these changes. However, this does not mean that all respondents were pessimistic; some may have believed that new types of jobs would be created as a result of AI advanc vice.\n\n(3) [TRUE], P = 0.98\nThe survey revealed strong support for protective measures against the risks associated with AI, with nearly nine in ten Europeans (around 87%) expressing this sentiment.
