VARIABLE: DQI-lite (Argumentation Quality)\nEvaluate ONLY the introductory commentary/essay (the descriptive part before the True/False list).\nScale 1-3:\n- 1 (Low): The commentary is superficial, one-sided, or relies on generalities/platitudes (e.g., \"AI is powerful\"). It lacks analytical structure or nuance.\n- 2 (Medium): The commentary is linguistically correct and acknowledges the complexity of the topic, but lacks depth, specific mechanisms, or concrete examples.\n- 3 (High): The commentary exhibits a clear analytical structure (e.g., thesis-antithesis, weighing arguments). It references specific mechanisms, data, or situates the issue in a broader regulatory/social context.\n\n2. VARIABLE: Source Presence (Verifiability)\nScan the ENTIRE text (both the essay and the justifications for True/False).\nScale 0-1 (Binary):\n- 0 (Absent): The text relies solely on vague attributions like \"studies show\", \"experts agree\", \"surveys suggest\", or \"reports indicate\" – without specific names.\n- 1 (Present): The text cites AT LEAST ONE specific proper name of a report, research institution, university, or study date that allows for identification (e.g., \"Eurobarometer 2022\", \"RAND report\", \"study by Allcott\", \"Facebook internal memo\").\n\n---\nPROCESS INSTRUCTIONS (Chain of Thought):\n\nStep 1: Analyze DQI.

Later, large randomized experiments conducted with Facebook and Instagram users during the 2020 US election — published in academic outlets and summarized in a 2025 policy brief by Allcott, Gentzkow and Levy — reported that removing political ads from people’s feeds had no significant effects on their political knowledge, attitudes, or likelihood of voting. Similarly, a 2023 study in Nature Communications on exposure to Russian troll content during the 2016 campaign found no measurable impact on voters’ opinions or turnout.
